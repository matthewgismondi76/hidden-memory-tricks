Maybe this is a better example since it has a real world parallel, and just like all the distributions probably get blamed for the code other people tamper with and never add any disclaimer which you would think I would be entitled to know if it truly had a good purpose. I would understand the need for it and would not be so angry about it. But instead, I feel cut off, disconnected, and throttled by strange connections in netstat from foreign governments or whatever. 

Here is another example of something that I don't know how to do, and I am not responsible for this code. I can't even say that Ubuntu is responsible or Linux or Debian or anyone else. My Debian certificates were coming through as not a match when I tried to use secure apt connections, and the only way I could figure out how to correct it was to just turn off the checking mechanism and accept that I was being given swapped out files somewhere. And I have found many expired certificates, many that do not match what the website says, and many that if I turn them off or delete them will break my system. That should not happen unless your certificates include fake ones that are not part of the overall legitimate chain, and I remember an article about a guy who deactivated all but one and still found every site he visited worked. It is supposed to be a trust network and not individual pockets of isolated entities.

So this is not just the rantings of a crazy paranoid schizo on drugs, as much as that likes to get thrown around most likely by the ones who have the capability to forge certificates and hide fragments of a had drive throughout empty space or "badram" space that is normally ignored. I don't know. But for years I have been kept from being able to freely access information because of some kind of control that has so often been timed perfectly to very specific times when it is way too easy to ignore everything I say because supposedly I am a crazy paranoid schizo on drugs. 

I am not, however. And in fact I have an entire entourage of people devoted to making sure that doesn't happen. I'm not sure if that is their actual purpose, But I'll forego the Psalm 91 rant again.

So anyway, I found this file in /lib/partman/lib/recipes.sh that shows a lot of very seemingly low-level piecing together of memory. It is in a partman folder, so you would expect there to be something related to creating partitions and mapping hard drives. But I also found in lsof a whole long list of what looked like fragments of something in memory. [and here the cursor just suddenly go super slow]
